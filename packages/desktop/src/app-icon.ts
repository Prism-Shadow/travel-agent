/**
 * Runtime window icon — pure path logic, no Electron imports (unit-tested).
 *
 * Only Linux (and Windows dev runs) need it: a packaged Windows app gets its taskbar
 * icon from the exe resources electron-builder embeds, and macOS ignores BrowserWindow
 * icons entirely (the Dock icon comes from the bundle's icns). The PNG lives at
 * build/icon.png both in the source package (committed, rendered from the canonical
 * brand SVG by `pnpm brand:generate`) and in the staged app directory (copied by
 * scripts/stage.mjs),
 * so the same app-path-relative lookup serves dev and packaged runs.
