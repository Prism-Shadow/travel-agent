/**
 * `/compact` after an abort: it must give clear feedback instead of silently doing nothing.
 *
 * When the first request is aborted, token_usage was never received -> core's sessionTurns is
 * still 0 -> `compact()` returns immediately, **producing no message at all**. The server used
 * to still return 202, so the frontend would wait forever for a compaction banner that never
 * comes — from the user's perspective, it just looks like "nothing happened after sending the
 * compact command." Now the server explicitly returns 409 based on `session.compactability()`.
 *
 * Second test case: compacting twice in a row. The internal state is identical to the above
 * (sessionTurns === 0), but the message the user should see is completely different — they just
 * finished a full round and just compacted, so being told "no completed conversation round yet"
 * would be absurd and effectively say nothing useful.
 *
 * This file is deliberately named to sort after chat.spec: the first user registered becomes the
 * admin, which chat.spec relies on, and Playwright runs spec files in filename order (the other
 * specs also sort after it).
