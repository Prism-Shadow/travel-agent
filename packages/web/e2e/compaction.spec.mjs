/**
 * Auto-compaction triggered at the **end** of a round: item order is
 * assistant_text -> compaction -> task_stats, with the compaction banner sandwiched between
 * the reply and its stats line.
 *
 * This ordering used to break the "reply + stats line" pairing, leaving the stats line
 * orphaned — and since the whole line is transparent by default, being orphaned meant it was
 * neither visible nor hoverable (the element's own `group` class has no effect on itself:
 * group-hover is a descendant selector). Now the entire round's AI-side content, stats line
 * included, is wrapped in the same group, so hovering any content in the round reveals it.
 *
 * Trigger mechanism: the mock's usage grows with context length, pinning the threshold between
 * "below the first request" and "above the second request (which carries the tool result)", so
 * compaction only happens once, at the end of the round.

/**
 * Manual `/compact` between two rounds: reloading the page must **not** rewrite the previous
 * round's tally.
 *
 * The server's startCompact requires the Session to be idle, so manual compaction always falls
 * outside a round. In the live stream, the previous round already closed at idle, so compaction's
 * usage and duration never fold into it; but history rebuild has no idle signal, so that round
 * still looks open — compaction's Token, cost, and elapsed time would get folded wholesale into
 * the previous round. The symptom: the same reply's stats look fine at first, then after a
 * reload they flip from "260 tokens · $0.0012 · 401ms" to "510 · $0.0020 · 1.7s".
 *
 * The unit test (stream-model) locks down the message sequence, but it can't lock down whether
 * a real `/compact` actually emits compaction_begin.reason === manual — that's exactly what the
 * frontend relies on to decide "compaction is outside the round," so this is covered end-to-end
 * here. Compaction is deliberately delayed by 3 seconds (the user reads the reply, then remembers
 * to compact): if that gap were counted, the elapsed time would jump from hundreds of
 * milliseconds to over 3 seconds.
