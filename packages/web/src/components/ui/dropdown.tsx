/**
 * Dropdown container (controlled): clicking outside collapses it; the panel is absolutely
 * positioned (z-40, per the layering convention — chrome avoids stacking contexts, in-flow
 * menus are z-40, overlays are z-50, and **portaled** popups are z-[60] so they clear an
 * open Modal, matching Select's portal panel). menuClass controls the docking direction and
 * width.
 *
 * `portal` switches the panel to the shared popup strategy (same idea as OptionMenu's
 * use-portal-panel): mounted on document.body with `position: fixed` against viewport
 * coordinates, so **no ancestor's overflow can clip it**. Anchoring inside a scrolling
 * container (the composer toolbar scrolls horizontally on phones) makes that mandatory:
 * setting one axis to a non-`visible` overflow makes the other compute to `auto` too, so an
 * absolutely-positioned panel — an upward one especially — is clipped away entirely.
 *
 * Escape goes through the shared esc-layer stack (see modal.tsx): while open, the menu is
 * the topmost layer, so one Escape closes only the menu even inside a Modal — the Modal's
 * own handler sees itself not on top and stays; the next Escape closes the dialog. The
 * event is deliberately NOT stopped, so element-level Escape handlers inside the panel
 * (e.g. an input reverting its draft) still run on the same press.
