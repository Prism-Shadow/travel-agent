/**
 * Composer input history (shell-style ↑/↓ recall): pure logic, unit-testable.
 *
 * History list: the session's previous composer inputs, oldest → newest, derived from the
 * stream items. Only text the user actually typed into the composer qualifies — regular
 * prompts (protocol blocks and attachment lines stripped) and mid-run steering messages.
 * Machine-injected texts are excluded: handoff / model-switch source blocks carry no user
 * prose, scheduled-trigger prompts were authored in the schedule config rather than typed
 * here.
 * Consecutive duplicates collapse (recalling the same text twice in a row is one entry),
 * matching shell behavior.
 *
 * Navigation: a small state machine the composer drives from ArrowUp/ArrowDown.
 * - Stepping back only starts from an effectively empty draft (a non-empty draft means the
 *   user is writing, and hijacking ↑ there would break in-text caret movement); whatever
 *   was in the box is stashed and restored when stepping forward past the newest entry.
 * - While navigating, any edit ends the session implicitly: the composer compares the
 *   current text against `recalled` and both steppers bail on a mismatch, handing ↑/↓ back
 *   to the caret. The oldest entry pins (repeated ↑ stays put, like a shell at the top of
 *   its history).
 * - The caret-line guards mirror multi-line shell behavior: within a recalled multi-line
 *   entry, ↑/↓ first walk the caret through the lines; only ↑ on the first line / ↓ on the
 *   last line step the history.
