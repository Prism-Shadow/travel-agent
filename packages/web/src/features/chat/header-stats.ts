/**
 * Chat toolbar cost chip: a per-session tracker that keeps the figure visible and monotone
 * while the session runs. Pure, no React — the chat page holds the mutable hold in a ref,
 * advances it once per render (idempotent per observation), and applies usage fetches to it
 * from the fetch effect; unit-tested in test/header-stats.test.ts.
 *
 * Why it exists: the naive `fetched sessionCost + open Task's live estimate` display blinked
 * out whenever both halves went empty at once — every Task boundary zeroes the live
 * buckets while the server keeps the session `running` (so an idle-gated refetch never ran),
 * a reload mid-run started with no fetched cost at all, and a refetch resolving in the idle
 * blip between queued follow-ups could return no row and clobber a known figure with null.
 *
 * Chosen semantics — the displayed figure is
 *
 *     sessionCost   (last applied fetch: absorbs everything recorded up to its resolve)
 *   + settledUsd    (live cost of Tasks finished SINCE that fetch, folded at each Task
 *                    boundary — a new Task keeps the running total instead of restarting)
 *   + max(0, open Task's live estimate − liveAtFetchUsd)
 *
 * where liveAtFetchUsd snapshots the open Task's live estimate at the moment a fetch applies:
 * the server prices usage rows in real time, so the fetched total already covers the running
 * Task's rows recorded so far, and only increments past the snapshot add on top — a mid-run
 * fetch reconciles the base without double-counting the running Task. A small transient skew
 * bounded by estimate-vs-server variance remains (the estimate applies the main Model's
 * pricing to all buckets); the next idle refetch settles it, exactly as it always has.
 *
 * Display rules on top of the sum:
 *   - once a figure was shown for a session it never disappears: when the computation has
 *     nothing (pricing transiently missing, model mid-rebuild) the last shown value holds;
 *   - while a Task is open the figure never goes down — a fetch reconciling below the live
 *     estimate holds the shown value until the sum passes it again; when idle the computed
 *     figure applies verbatim (the authoritative reconcile may adjust either way, as the
 *     idle refetch always has);
 *   - a brand-new session with no recorded cost and a still-zero estimate shows nothing
 *     (not $0.00), and a recorded zero-cost session still shows $0 — both unchanged;
 *   - everything resets only on session switch (advanceCostStat re-keys on sessionId).
